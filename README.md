## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm trag1c.
I mostly code in Python, currently working on [Crossandra 2.1.0](https://github.com/trag1c/crossandra), [Paperbush 0.3.0](https://github.com/trag1c/paperbush), [Samarium 0.6.0](https://github.com/samarium-lang/Samarium), Pepperbox and Tantalum.

Get in touch on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CNQ4EYjC2J)!

## Projects
- [Samarium](https://github.com/samarium-lang/Samarium) - an implementation of one of my programming languages.
- [Dahlia](https://github.com/dahlia-lib) - libraries for multiple languages for easy and concise color and style formatting in the terminal, inspired by Minecraft.
- [Crossandra](https://github.com/trag1c/crossandra) - a simple and decently configurable tokenization library for Python, based on enums and regular expressions.
- [Ixia](https://github.com/trag1c/ixia) - a library connecting [secrets](https://docs.python.org/3/library/secrets.html)' security with [random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html)'s versatility.
- [Paperbush](https://github.com/trag1c/paperbush) - a super concise argument parsing tool for Python.
- [PEP Tracker](https://github.com/trag1c/pep-tracker) - a dead simple CLI tool for checking PEP updates.

I also made a [color theme](https://github.com/trag1c/gleam-theme) for VSCode!

## Maintaining
- [mCodingBot](https://github.com/mcb-dev/mCodingBot) - the Discord bot for the mCoding Discord server.
- (until Dec 26, 2022 ðŸ’”) [Pincer](https://github.com/Pincer-org/Pincer) - the snappy asynchronous Discord API wrapper written with aiohttp.
